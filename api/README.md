- Login.php will likely be what the finish login api is based off of.  Currently tests to see if database is connected and can read out the login info.
  When frontend is connected it will check to see if inputted data and database match.
- userLogin.php was used to test if all username was used to see if all usernames could be read, probably useless as passwords cant be read
  possibly due to being too large for php array.
